Hello world! I am a research scientist at [AppTek](https://www.apptek.com). I completed my master's in [Language Science and Technology](https://www.uni-saarland.de/en/department/lst/research.html) from Saarland University. During my master's, I worked at the [Multilingual Technologies Lab, DFKI](https://www.dfki.de/en/web/research/research-departments/multilinguality-and-language-technology) under the supervision of [Koel Dutta Chowdhury](https://www.uni-saarland.de/lehrstuhl/genabith/mitarbeiter/koel-dutta-chowdhury.html) and [Prof. Dr. Josef van Genabith](https://www.uni-saarland.de/lehrstuhl/genabith.html), and was a reseach intern in the Language Modeling team at Apple Siri.

My current research focuses on evaluating the capabilities of large language models, leveraging their strengths and identifying areas where they fall short. My interests also lie in learning culture-aware multilingual representations and bias mitigation. In general, I find myself drawn to new research directions as I read more.
